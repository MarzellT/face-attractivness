- Click the green button "Clone or download" and then "Download ZIP".           
- Locate it in your downloads folder
1. Double click the folder
2. Move folder `face-attractivness-master` to your desktop
- Windows users follow the steps in the section **Windows** now

## Windows:point_left:
### 1. Install Python3üêç
- Go to <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>   
- Download and install the latest version of Python3.   
1.**Mark _‚òëÔ∏è Add Python 3.X to PATH_ in the installer.**

2. Click **Install Now**
- Proceed with step **Install dependencies**

### Install dependenciesü§®
~~Open cmd (if you don't know how simply open the start menu and search for cmd).
Type `cd reposdirectory` (reposdirector is the path to where you have downloaded the files
for example `cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\face-attractivness-master` where YourName is 
the name of the current Windows user. This name is actually displayed when you open the cmd.)     
Now type `pip install -r requirements.txt`.~~   
üòè      
Actually forget that stuff. 
üòÖ
I implemented a much simpler feature.
- Double Click the **windows_setup** file from this folder.
- If a blue screen like this opens click **more Info** and then **run anyways**

## Advancedü§ì (You can skip that go to usage)
If you want you can also create a virtualenvironment specifically for this repository.      
To do so simply type `virtualenv venv` in the folder of this repository.      
Then you want to activate it by typing `source venv/bin/activate`.     
Now you can `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your virtualenvironment.    
To leave the virtualenvironment simply type `deactivate` or leave your terminal session.     

# Usageüë©‚Äçüíª  
- Windows users proceed with **Windows** section
## Windows
### What you need to do
- Double click face_rating.py         
- After finishing a new file will be in the folder called **ratings.csv**
- Send me this fileüíå     
- My email is <tobias.marzell@gmail.com>.     
You can also send me the file through any other service.üïä

### Advanced
You can also run this program through your terminal with arguments.    
Takes the directory of the images as arguments.     
Example: `python3 face_rating.py data/raten/*`.     
If you specify the location you can use complete or relative path.       

# Additional
You can create your own image folder using choices.py.     
This requries that images of differenct people are in differenct subfolders
because it will randomly select 1 picture of those folders. This ensures that
no person is selected twice.
`choices.py` does not use any dependecies.    
To run choices.py you must enter `choices.py arg1 args`.     
`arg1` is the amount of pictures you want and args are the folders in which your pictures are.    
 
# Todo
Assumption: I can assume that the score of one picture of one person generalises to all pictures of this person.    
I can use this assumption to train on all images of that person to have more train data.     
- Implement training based on this assumption.    
    
Idea: I want to save all images and their rating based on above assumption.    
In my first implementation i saved all images into a list and their ratings into seperate ordered lists.    
The lists are ordered by the filenames. This implementation is very bad though.     
The main reason is complexity. Instead I want to use a dictionary contating the information now.
I think I should create a dictionary in form of:     
{filename1: [list of ratings]}     
{filename2: [list of ratings]}     
{filename3: [list of ratings]}     
{filename4: [list of ratings]}     
		...  
{filenamen-3: [list of ratings]}     
{filenamen-2: [list of ratings]}     
{filenamen-1: [list of ratings]}     
{filenamen: [list of ratings]}     
I will save every single filename into this dictionary including the ones from the same folder(which implies the same person).
What I currently do is saving all information into a list and then check the list for already present filenames then
either appending to the list of raitngs or creating a new list and then appending to the list (depending on the case obviously).
